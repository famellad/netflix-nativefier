# netflix-nativefier
Code to get Netflix working as a native app using the nodejs nativefier

## Requirements
You need [nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) installed and working.

## Usage
Just run the build.sh script, and it will build the app for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

You can open it and comment, the corresponding lines to just build the binaries you need.

## TODO
- Figure out the regex for the internal-urls
- Figure out the correct user-agent string for the Windows build
- Get a MacOS tester.
